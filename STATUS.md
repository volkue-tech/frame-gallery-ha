# Project status

Last updated: 2026-09-26

## Current phase

**Phase 2 (core skeleton, deterministic selection and rendering): in progress.**

- Codex gave final approval of Phase 1 at commit `ffca958` and authorized Phase 2 only.
- Gate adjustment, explicitly approved by Codex: verification of the remaining lower-risk `pillow.libs` entries moved from the Phase 2 gate to the authoritative Phase 6 runtime-wheel inspection. Full verification remains mandatory before packaging or publication, and the GPL/LGPL licence review and source-availability obligations remain release blockers.
- This documentation commit records the approval and the gate adjustment. No application code has been written yet.

## Completed

### Phase 0: specification package (Codex)

- Created the isolated repository.
- Recorded the product requirements.
- Defined the independent-development boundaries.
- Wrote the acceptance tests.
- Wrote the agent instructions.
- Defined the phases and approval gates.

### Phase 1, revision 1: architecture proposal (Claude, commit `8ea5491`)

- Researched permitted sources only, with independent re-checks.
- Ran an internal multi-agent review; 58 confirmed findings were incorporated.
- Wrote `ARCHITECTURE.md` and the first `DECISIONS.md` (decisions, inventory, risks, questions).

### Phase 1, revision 2: Codex review applied (Claude, commit `4ea3e36`)

**Beta providers**

- Google Arts & Culture and Bing are removed from the beta. Their researched status is kept in `ARCHITECTURE.md` §9.4 and in the new *Researched and excluded sources* section of `PRODUCT_SPEC.md`.
- The beta sources are now **local media, the Art Institute of Chicago, and the Cleveland Museum of Art**.
- Cleveland is part of the normative design (D-136). Only CC0 records are used, and only the documented 3400 px print JPEG, never the TIFF.

**Filters**

- Four distinct filters: source/museum, department/collection, style/period, and colour.
- A capability matrix shows which source supports which filter.
- Unsupported filters are visibly reported in the log, the summary line, and the run record (D-124).

**Runtime**

- A **120 s** default hard deadline, split 10 / 60 / 40 / 10 s, with all timeouts clamped.
- `no_match` finishes within **70 s**.
- A 150 s dashboard timer indicator.
- 30 remote dimension requests, and a separate allowance for local header reads (D-114).

**Duplicate prevention**

- A **TV-upload exclusion ledger** with a write-ahead uncertainty quarantine (D-137).
- The confirmed sent history, the current artwork, and the preview still change only after the TV confirms selection.
- New acceptance items `E7`–`E10`.

**Preview**

- The Local File camera stays the primary design, and its platform basis is recorded (D-111).
- Freshness is **release-blocking**: Phase 8 must prove one refresh mechanism (D-140).
- Collection Image (2026.9+) is an optional alternative only, and does not raise the minimum Home Assistant version.

**Approved decisions recorded**

- `frame_gallery` as the provisional identifier (D-138).
- Apache-2.0 (D-102).
- `uv` (D-128).
- An IPv4 literal for the TV address (D-125). The test value `192.168.178.30` is never hard-coded.
- No `host_network` initially (Q-16).
- Inspect only the installed `samsungtvws` 3.0.6 (D-104).
- `contain`, landscape-only, and strict 16:9 on by default, with no crop (D-123).
- Bounded cleanup and atomic writes (D-106, D-110).
- Beta scope (D-120), including its three sources (D-132, D-136); the adapter details are still proposed.
- The top-level budget (D-114): 120 s total, split 10/60/40/10, `no_match` within 70 s, 30 remote probes. The sub-budgets are proposed.

**Implementation sequencing**

- A vertical slice (D-139). `TASKS.md` Phases 2–9 are restructured to match.

**Specification amendments**

- `PRODUCT_SPEC.md` and `ACCEPTANCE_TESTS.md` are amended as directed, each with an amendment log.
- Unrelated text is preserved.
- New acceptance items are appended, so existing IDs stay stable.

**Research and checks**

- The Cleveland Open Access and Home Assistant preview options were researched from documentation pages only. Key facts were independently re-checked; the citation guidance and the refresh cadence were not.
- Cross-reference and consistency checks were run, followed by an independent review of this revision.

### Phase 1, final gate corrections: Codex final gate review of `4ea3e36` applied (Claude, this commit)

**Pillow licensing correction**

- The earlier claim that the Pillow PyPI wheels omit `libimagequant` was false and has been withdrawn.
- The Pillow 12.3.0 wheels bundle GPL-3.0-or-later `libimagequant` 4.4.1 and LGPL-2.1-or-later FriBiDi 1.0.16 (with its shim). The full bundled-library inventory from the Codex inspection is recorded in `DECISIONS.md`. The remaining `pillow.libs` entries are marked for verification.
- Apache-2.0 covers project-owned code only (D-102). The runtime image is **not** GPL-free.
- `libimagequant` and FriBiDi are added to the copyleft review (D-135). The qualified licence review stays a release gate, and R-25 records the risk.
- Pillow 12.3.0 stays proposed. The inspection will be repeated against the exact runtime wheels once the Python version is fixed; that result is authoritative (D-130, `TASKS.md` Phase 6).

**Development-only rows**

- `mypy-extensions` 1.1.0 (MIT) and `pathspec` 1.1.1 (MPL-2.0) were recorded; neither is shipped.

**Decisions accepted**

- Q-03 (D-116): square band 0.95–1/0.95; strict near-16:9 is ±1 %, `abs(ln(r / (16/9))) <= ln(1.01)` (about 1.760–1.796); maximum upscale 2.5×. The strict threshold may be revisited after Phase 8.
- Q-11 (D-117): fallback only with landscape-only and `contain`; no fallback in `cover`.
- Q-12 (D-125): RFC 1918 IPv4 literals only; link-local, loopback, unspecified, multicast, broadcast, and the container and Supervisor networks are rejected. `192.168.178.30` is used only as the Phase 8 test value.
- Q-23 (D-137): a 30-day uncertainty quarantine.
- Q-18 item 4 (D-113): history is recorded before the preview is published.
- Q-09 (§16.3, D-114, D-140): the UI card, script, 150 s timer helper, enabled Running sensor, and optional post-run automation.
- Q-08 (D-120, D-123): the Art Institute of Chicago is the default remote source.
- Q-04 (D-118): the candidate fingerprint.

**Specification amendments**

- `PRODUCT_SPEC.md`: the RFC 1918 address rule, lifecycle steps 9 and 10 swapped, the strict ±1 % definition, and the 30-day quarantine. Each change is recorded in its amendment log.
- `ACCEPTANCE_TESTS.md`: B7 reworded in place for RFC 1918. No IDs changed.

## Specification deviations still awaiting decision

None. The lifecycle order (D-113) was accepted and the specification amended.

## Next action

Implement Phase 2, then stop at the Phase 3 approval gate.

**Decisions needed, by phase:**

| Before | Decisions |
| --- | --- |
| Phase 2 | **Approved** (Codex final approval of Phase 1 at `ffca958`): the architecture, the development-only dependency rows, and the Pillow row with its corrected bundled-library inventory. |
| Phase 3 | Q-14, Q-22. The `urllib3` and `certifi` rows. Any observation requests. |
| Phase 4 | None (Q-23 and D-113 accepted). |
| Phase 5 | The `samsungtvws` row and its LGPL-3.0 obligations (D-135). |
| Phase 6 | The base-image pull (D-130); Q-06, Q-10; the Buildx, QEMU, and SBOM-tool rows. The authoritative Pillow runtime-wheel inspection, including the remaining `pillow.libs` entries (mandatory before packaging or publication). |
| Phase 8 | Explicit approval for the live run; Q-21 (install route). |
| Phase 9 | D-101 (final name), Q-13 (repository URL); the builder-action and Cosign rows; the qualified licence review (D-135, release gate); approval to publish. |

## External state

- No Home Assistant changes; no `configuration.yaml` touched.
- No television connection attempted.
- No GitHub repository accessed, created, or modified; no GitHub-hosted page fetched.
- No container image pulled, built, or published.
- No dependency installed.
- No provider API or image endpoint called. Research read public documentation pages, policy pages, and `robots.txt` files, plus one Microsoft Q&A answer (cited as a non-documentation source) and search-result snippets where a page blocked automated readers. Reading used web-fetch tools, `curl` (including PyPI's JSON metadata API), and the in-app browser.
- Apache-2.0 is approved. The `LICENSE` file will be added when publication is prepared (Phase 9).

## Known open decisions

See `DECISIONS.md` for the full list. The most material:

- **Preview freshness mechanism** (D-140). This is release-blocking and is selected in Phase 8.
- **Copyleft components in the runtime image** (R-25, D-135). The Pillow wheels bundle GPL-3.0-or-later `libimagequant` and LGPL-2.1-or-later FriBiDi. The qualified licence review is a release gate.
- **Final name** (D-101). The trademark wording is tracked as R-14.
- **Copyleft source-availability mechanism** (D-135).
